## Overview

**PATH** (Path API & Toolkit Harness) is an open source framework for enabling access to a decentralized supply network. It provides various tools and libraries to streamline the integration and interaction with decentralized protocols.

This repo is maintained by the Pocket Network community, and is used to service the [free Public RPC endpoints](https://api.pocket.network). The backend and portal should be considered opinionated examples of interfacing with the Pocket Network protocol. You are welcome to fork and remix however you like.
